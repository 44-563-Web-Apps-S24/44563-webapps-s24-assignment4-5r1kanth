    <h1>Srikanth Pamulapati does Chekov tonight</h1>

    <h3>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Act THREE - Anton Chekov</h3>


    <p>
        TROFIMOV. [To PISCHIN] If the energy which you, in the course of your
        life, have spent in looking for money to pay interest had been used
        for something else, then, I believe, after all, you'd be able to turn
        everything upside down.

        PISCHIN. Nietzsche... a philosopher... a very great, a most celebrated
        man... a man of enormous brain, says in his books that you can forge
        bank-notes.

        TROFIMOV. And have you read Nietzsche?

        PISCHIN. Well... Dashenka told me. Now I'm in such a position, I
        wouldn't mind forging them... I've got to pay 310 roubles the day after
        to-morrow... I've got 130 already.... [Feels his pockets, nervously]
        I've lost the money! The money's gone! [Crying] Where's the money?
        [Joyfully] Here it is behind the lining... I even began to perspire.

        [Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA and CHARLOTTA IVANOVNA.]

        LUBOV. [Humming a Caucasian dance] Why is Leonid away so long? What's he
        doing in town? [To DUNYASHA] Dunyasha, give the musicians some tea.

        TROFIMOV. Business is off, I suppose.

        LUBOV. And the musicians needn't have come, and we needn't have got up
        this ball.... Well, never mind.... [Sits and sings softly.]

        CHARLOTTA. [Gives a pack of cards to PISCHIN] Here's a pack of cards,
        think of any one card you like.

        PISCHIN. I've thought of one.

        CHARLOTTA. Now shuffle. All right, now. Give them here, oh my dear
        Mr. Pischin. _Ein, zwei, drei_! Now look and you'll find it in your
        coat-tail pocket.

        PISCHIN. [Takes a card out of his coat-tail pocket] Eight of spades,
        quite right! [Surprised] Think of that now!

        CHARLOTTA. [Holds the pack of cards on the palm of her hand. To
        TROFIMOV] Now tell me quickly. What's the top card?

        TROFIMOV. Well, the queen of spades.

        CHARLOTTA. Right! [To PISCHIN] Well now? What card's on top?

        PISCHIN. Ace of hearts.
