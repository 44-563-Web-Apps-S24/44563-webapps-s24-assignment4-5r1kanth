    <h1>Srikanth Pamulapati does Chekov tonight</h1>

    <h3>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Act THREE - Anton Chekov</h3>


    <h6>TROFIMOV.</h6>
    <p>[To PISCHIN]</p>
    <p>If the energy which you, in the course of your
        life, have spent in looking for money to pay interest had been used
        for something else, then, I believe, after all, you'd be able to turn
        everything upside down.</p>


    <h6>PISCHIN.</h6>
    <p>Nietzsche... a philosopher... a very great, a most celebrated
        man... a man of enormous brain, says in his books that you can forge
        bank-notes.</p>

    <h6>TROFIMOV.</h6>
    <p>And have you read Nietzsche?</p>

    <h6>PISCHIN.</h6>
    <p>Well... Dashenka told me. Now I'm in such a position, I
        wouldn't mind forging them... I've got to pay 310 roubles the day after
        to-morrow... I've got 130 already....
    <p>[Feels his pockets, nervously]</p>
    <p>I've lost the money! The money's gone!</p>
    <p>[Crying]</p>
    <p>Where's the money?</p>
    <p>[Joyfully]</p>
    <p>Here it is behind the lining... I even began to perspire.</p>

    <p>[Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA and CHARLOTTA IVANOVNA.]</p>


    <h6>LUBOV.</h6>
    <p>[Humming a Caucasian dance]</p>
    <p>Why is Leonid away so long? What's he
        doing in town?</p>
    <p>[To DUNYASHA]</p>
    <p>Dunyasha, give the musicians some tea.</p>


    <h6>TROFIMOV.</h6>
    <p>Business is off, I suppose.</p>


    <h6>LUBOV.</h6>
    <p>And the musicians needn't have come, and we needn't have got up
        this ball.... Well, never mind....</p>
    <p>[Sits and sings softly.]</p>


    <h6>CHARLOTTA.</h6>
    <p>[Gives a pack of cards to PISCHIN]</p>
    <p>Here's a pack of cards,
        think of any one card you like.</p>


    <h6>PISCHIN.</h6>
    <p>I've thought of one.</p>


    <h6>CHARLOTTA.</h6>
    <p>Now shuffle. All right, now. Give them here, oh my dear
        Mr. Pischin. _Ein, zwei, drei_! Now look and you'll find it in your
        coat-tail pocket.</p>


    <h6>PISCHIN.</h6>
    <p>[Takes a card out of his coat-tail pocket]</p>
    <p>Eight of spades, quite right!</p>
    <p>[Surprised]</p>
    <p>Think of that now!</p>


    <h6>CHARLOTTA.</h6>
    <p>[Holds the pack of cards on the palm of her hand. To TROFIMOV]</p>
    <p>Now tell me quickly. What's the top card?</p>


    <h6>TROFIMOV.</h6>
    <p>Well, the queen of spades.</p>


    <h6>CHARLOTTA.</h6>
    <p>Right!</p>
    <p>[To PISCHIN]</p>
    <p>Well now? What card's on top?</p>


    <h6>PISCHIN.</h6>
    <p>Ace of hearts.</p>
