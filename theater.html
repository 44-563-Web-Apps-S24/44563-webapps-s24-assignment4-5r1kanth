    <h1>Srikanth Pamulapati does Chekov tonight</h1>

    <h2>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Act THREE - Anton Chekov</h2>

<p>
    <h4>TROFIMOV.</h4>
        <p>[To PISCHIN]</p> If the energy which you, in the course of your
        life, have spent in looking for money to pay interest had been used
        for something else, then, I believe, after all, you'd be able to turn
        everything upside down.</p>

        <p>
        <h4>PISCHIN.</h4> Nietzsche... a philosopher... a very great, a most celebrated
        man... a man of enormous brain, says in his books that you can forge
        bank-notes.</p>

        <p><h4>TROFIMOV.</h4> And have you read Nietzsche?</p>

        <p><h4>PISCHIN.</h4> Well... Dashenka told me. Now I'm in such a position, I
        wouldn't mind forging them... I've got to pay 310 roubles the day after
        to-morrow... I've got 130 already.... <p>[Feels his pockets, nervously]</p>
        I've lost the money! The money's gone! <p>[Crying]</p> Where's the money?
        <p>[Joyfully]</p> Here it is behind the lining... I even began to perspire.</p>

        <p>[Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA and CHARLOTTA IVANOVNA.]</p>

        <p><h4>LUBOV.</h4> <p>[Humming a Caucasian dance]</p> Why is Leonid away so long? What's he
        doing in town? <p>[To DUNYASHA]</p> Dunyasha, give the musicians some tea.</p>

        <p><h4>TROFIMOV.</h4> Business is off, I suppose.</p>

        <p><h4>LUBOV.</h4> And the musicians needn't have come, and we needn't have got up
        this ball.... Well, never mind.... [Sits and sings softly.]</p>

        <p><h4>CHARLOTTA.</h4> <p>[Gives a pack of cards to PISCHIN]</p> Here's a pack of cards,
        think of any one card you like.</p>

        <p><h4>PISCHIN.</h4> I've thought of one.</p>

        <p><h4>CHARLOTTA.</h4> Now shuffle. All right, now. Give them here, oh my dear
        Mr. Pischin. _Ein, zwei, drei_! Now look and you'll find it in your
        coat-tail pocket.</p>

        <p><h4>PISCHIN.</h4> <p>[Takes a card out of his coat-tail pocket]</p> Eight of spades,
        quite right! <p>[Surprised]</p> Think of that now!</p>

        <p><h4>CHARLOTTA.</h4> <p>[Holds the pack of cards on the palm of her hand. To
        TROFIMOV]</p> Now tell me quickly. What's the top card?</p>

        <p><h4>TROFIMOV.</h4> Well, the queen of spades.</p>

        <p><h4>CHARLOTTA.</h4> Right! <p>[To PISCHIN]</p> Well now? What card's on top?</p>

        <p><h4>PISCHIN.</h4> Ace of hearts.</p>
