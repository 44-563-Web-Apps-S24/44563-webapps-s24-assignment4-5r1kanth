    <h3>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Act THREE - Anton Chekov</h3>
    <div class="play">
        <h6 class="trofimov">TROFIMOV.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[To PISCHIN]</p>
        <p class="speech">If the energy which you, in the course of your
            life, have spent in looking for money to pay interest had been used
            for something else, then, I believe, after all, you'd be able to turn
            everything upside down.</p>

        <h6 class="pischin">PISCHIN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Nietzsche... a philosopher... a very great, a most celebrated
            man... a man of enormous brain, says in his books that you can forge
            bank-notes.</p>

        <h6 class="trofimov">TROFIMOV.</h6>
        <p class="speech">And have you read Nietzsche?</p>

        <h6 class="pischin">PISCHIN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Well... Dashenka told me. Now I'm in such a position, I
            wouldn't mind forging them... I've got to pay 310 roubles the day after
            to-morrow... I've got 130 already....
        <p class="direction">[Feels his pockets, nervously]</p>
        <p class="speech">I've lost the money! The money's gone!</p>
        <p class="direction">[Crying]</p>
        <p class="speech">Where's the money?</p>
        <p class="direction">[Joyfully]</p>
        <p class="speech">Here it is behind the lining... I even began to perspire.</p>

        <p class="direction">[Enter LUBOV ANDREYEVNA and CHARLOTTA IVANOVNA.]</p>

        <h6 class="lubov">LUBOV.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Humming a Caucasian dance]</p>
        <p class="speech">Why is Leonid away so long? What's he
            doing in town?</p>
        <p class="direction">[To DUNYASHA]</p>
        <p class="speech">Dunyasha, give the musicians some tea.</p>

        <h6 class="trofimov">TROFIMOV.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Business is off, I suppose.</p>

        <h6 class="lubov">LUBOV.</h6>
        <p class="speech">And the musicians needn't have come, and we needn't have got up
            this ball.... Well, never mind....</p>
        <p class="direction">[Sits and sings softly.]</p>

        <h6 class="charlotta">CHARLOTTA.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Gives a pack of cards to PISCHIN]</p>
        <p class="speech">Here's a pack of cards,
            think of any one card you like.</p>

        <h6 class="pischin">PISCHIN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I've thought of one.</p>

        <h6 class="charlotta">CHARLOTTA.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Now shuffle. All right, now. Give them here, oh my dear
            Mr. Pischin. _Ein, zwei, drei_! Now look and you'll find it in your
            coat-tail pocket.</p>

        <h6 class="pischin">PISCHIN.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Takes a card out of his coat-tail pocket]</p>
        <p class="speech">Eight of spades, quite right!</p>
        <p class="direction">[Surprised]</p>
        <p class="speech">Think of that now!</p>

        <h6 class="charlotta">CHARLOTTA.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Holds the pack of cards on the palm of her hand. To TROFIMOV]</p>
        <p class="speech">Now tell me quickly. What's the top card?</p>

        <h6 class="trofimov">TROFIMOV.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Well, the queen of spades.</p>

        <h6 class="charlotta">CHARLOTTA.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Right!</p>
        <p class="direction">[To PISCHIN]</p>
        <p class="speech">Well now? What card's on top?</p>

        <h6 class="pischin">PISCHIN.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Ace of hearts.</p>
